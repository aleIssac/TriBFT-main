This project is developed based on BlockSimulator and includes the implementation code for the paper "TriBFT IoV: A Trustworthy Consensus System Based on Adaptive Three Layer Architecture for Large Scale Internet of Vehicles". TriBFT has implemented a highly scalable Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus framework, providing a three-layer architecture for vehicular network blockchain and vehicular reputation evaluation model for large-scale vehicular networking. A complete runtime environment needs to be integrated with BlockSimulator.
